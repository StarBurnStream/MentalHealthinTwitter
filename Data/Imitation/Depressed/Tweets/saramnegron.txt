One of my earliest queer memories is how happy I felt seeing the Britney and Madonna kiss in a magazine.
I have a lot of repressed anger at family members who always say I should compete in Miss Universe yet never ask me about my studies.
I thoroughly enjoy going to the movies alone.
I write poetry sometimes but I don't read it more than once because I make myself cringe.
I came out last year.
@queridacarola Hi hello same
I don't eat seafood.
I was originally going to study chemistry.
When I was a kid I used to open gifts in another room just in case I didn't like some, prepare my fake gratitute to not make people feel bad
I despise surprises of any kind. Just, no.
I used to want to be a drummer but got over it once I realized I have absolutely no rhythm.
I have a sea creature phobia. Not to be confused with a phobia of the sea, just the things that live in it.
I usually prefer to paint with watercolors or gouache. I don't like acrylics and I'm still learning to paint with oils.
My favorite movie of all time is The Devil Wears Prada.
I am diagnosed with endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, trochanteric bursitis, OCD, depression and panic disorder. I am not ashamed.
I hate normal coffee. The only coffee I ever enjoyed drinking were some one of my ex mother in laws used to make me. I only drink mocha now.
I used to be a gymnast &amp; in my 1st year of college I was in the cheer team but had to leave because I had to start a medical treatment.
In high school, I was the valedictorian, class president, in charge of the prom arrangements and voted most popular + most artistic.
I used to hate cats until I rescued one with someone a few months ago in Río Piedras. Sadly he had to be put down due to his severe injuries
I've collected all the movie tickets I've bought since 2008.
When I was in elementary school some bullies called me "eggroll" but I was unbothered because I was the smartest kid in the school 🤷🏻‍♀️
My middle name is Mercedes. 
I used to be embarrassed about it but now idgaf. All the car jokes are overused, too.
I have a corgi mix I named Ruby because when I was 7 I was obsessed with Pokémon Ruby.

... because they're unaware of this condition. Here are some myths about Endo https://t.co/6EYmEX0ko0
It is so incredibly common, I urge all to share this information and research further. Perhaphs a woman in your life suffers in silence...
It is known as an "invisible" illness. Many don't understand or consider the pain to be real because it cannot be seen.
... challenging for me to attend school, walk or even sleep. I have no shame in sharing my personal story in hopes of creating awareness.
... frequently, many doctors dismiss it as simply "period pain". I was misdiagnosed for three years, enduring severe pain that became...
... at age 18. I am currently on birth control pills for the pain yet it does not help with Endo itself. This condition is misdiagnosed...
... which lasted 3 months and it resulted in absolutely no significant change whatsoever. It put me through a medically induced menopause...
I have been through two laparoscopies for now, dismissed the antibiotics and also been through the hormonal treatment Lupron Depot...
Each treatment result varies depending on the individual's body and the stage they're in (I'm at stage 2) https://t.co/vP6kLIGg6A
As I said: it is chronic - it has no cure. There are very few treatment options available and none guarantee relief.
... and it is one of the leading causes of infertility among women. Note: it does NOT equal infertility.
Symptoms include: severe and spontaneous pelvic pain that increases when menstruating, painful intercourse, pain with bowel movements...
It's origin is still relatively unknown. In some cases (like mine) it is hereditary.
It occurs when endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus. The only proper diagnosis is through a laparoscopy surgery.
Endometriosis is a chronic illness that 1 in 10 women have - approximately 176 million accross the world.
I'm in so much pain right now, it's the perfect time to start this #EndometriosisAwareness thread 🎗
