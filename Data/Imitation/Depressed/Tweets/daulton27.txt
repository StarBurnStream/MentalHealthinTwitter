He didn't kill himself the way she did, he didn't say anything about the show/books. He lefts things behind. So please stop blaming the show
The article says alleged because he left behind things for people. If I killed myself now I'd leave notes for ppl, not because of the show.

People are shady, never know who's really your friend or just there to watch you fall.
It was a joke not a dick don't take it so hard.

People change, I'm glad I'm not the same person I was a year ago.
A pretty face doesn't equal anything if you have an ugly personality.
People who cheat on people who care about them are pretty low.
